# Deepfake-Detection-Model
Aim :- Audio-Visual Forensics: Detecting Deepfakes Across Modalities
	(Strengthen Digital Media Security)

Objective : 1.  Create multi-model system 
	    2. Identify Deepfakes in images, video and audio.

Problem : Identity theft

CREATE : A website where people can upload images, videos and audio and system
	 will tell if it is deepfake or not(percentage).

Current Scenario :
Best Model : FACTOR (dataset - FakeAvCeleb
website :- https://deepfake-detect.com/

Google SynthAI - Creates watermarks 
Intel : https://www.youtube.com/shorts/e37zhGVkazY

What we can learn : 
1. Gen AI, CV, DL
2. GAN, CNN, RNN
3. maybe NLP
